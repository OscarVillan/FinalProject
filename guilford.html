    <div class="coursetext">The Meadows at Guilford College is a private course maintained by players, it has seen better days but still boasts 18 holes and many tee signs. The course has a lot of variety however when it has not been mowed in awhile, you will spend a lot of time looking for your discs in high grass.
        This course features large field holes with upward and downward elevation. The course is not for new players and has many wooded areas and creeks where discs can easily fall. 
    </div>
    <div>The course was founded in 2012 and designed by Nate Secrest and Jake Fulkerson. The par for the course is 56 and the tees are rubber. The parking capacity for the course is also very small holding about 6 cars. There are no restrooms or water fountains.</div>
