                <div class="rules">The objective of disc golf is to throw a disc into the basket with the least amount
                    of
                    throws (strokes). The player with the <em>least</em> amount of throws (strokes) after 9 or 18
                    baskets
                    wins.</div>
            </div>

                <div class="rulelabel">Safety Rules</div>
                <div class="rules">Be aware of your surroundings and <em>never</em> throw when others are in your
                    throwing range. Give park users right of way.</div>

            <div class="rule">
                <div class="rulelabel">Teeing Off</div>
                <div class="rules">Each basket starts with a tee throw which is thrown from inside or behind the
                    designated tee area.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="rule">
                <div class="rulelabel">Lie / Laying</div>
                <div class="rules">The lie is the location where a player's previous throw has landed. It should be
                    marked with a marker disc or the previous disc thrown and all throws must be made from behind the
                    lie. If a disc lands within 10m of the basket then the player must maintain balance and not pass the
                    lie until the disc has rested. Some disc golf vernacular is "laying x" where x is the amount of
                    throws completed by a player. </div>

                <div class="rules">The player with the least strokes leading into a basket tees first, then the player
                    with the second least strokes etc... After the tee off the player farthest from the basket throws
                    first and this continues until the basket is completed by all players.</div>

            <div class="rule">
                <div class="rulelabel">Mandatory Obstacles</div>
                <div class="rules">Mandatory obstacles or "Mandos" are designated trees or poles that must be passed on
                    the correct side indicated by an arrow. If a player fails to pass on the correct side they must take
                    a +1 penalty stroke and either return to the previous lie or throw from a designated drop zone if
                    applicable.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="rule">
                <div class="rulelabel">Completed Basket</div>
                <div class="rules">A basket is completed when a disc comes to a rest inside the basket. A disc that
                    lands on top of a basket does not count and the lie for the next throw is directly under the disc.

                    noise. Whenever possible let faster paced groups pass.</div>
