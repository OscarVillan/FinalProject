        <p>The Rules</p>
        <p>The objective of disc golf is to throw a disc into the basket with the least amount of throws (strokes). The player with the <em>least</em> amount of throws (strokes) after 9 or 18 baskets wins.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="rulelist">
        <div class="rule">Safety Rules
            <p>Be aware of your surroundings and <em>never</em> throw when others are in your throwing range. Give park users right of way.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule">Teeing Off
            <p>Each basket starts with a tee throw which is thrown from inside or behind the designated tee area.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule">Lie
            <p>The lie is the location where a player's previous throw has landed. It should be marked with a marker disc or the previous disc thrown and all throws must be made from behind the lie. If a disc lands within 10m of the basket then the player must maintain balance and not pass the lie until the disc has rested.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule">Throwing Order
            <p>The player with the least strokes leading into a basket tees first, then the player with the second least strokes etc... After the tee off the player farthest from the basket throws first and this continues until the basket is completed by all players.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule">Mandatory Obstacles
            <p>Mandatory obstacles or "Mandos" are designated trees or poles that must be passed on the correct side indicated by an arrow. If a player fails to pass on the correct side they must take a +1 penalty stroke and either return to the previous lie or throw from a designated drop zone if applicable.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule">Completed Basket
            <p>A basket is completed when a disc comes to a rest inside the basket. A disc that lands on top of a basket does not count and the lie for the next throw is directly under the disc.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="rule">General Etiquette
            <p>Be courteous to park users. Do not stand infront of throwing players. Be mindful of noise. Whenever possible let faster paced groups pass.</p>
